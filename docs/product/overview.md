# Product Overview

LangDAO is a community platform where people use their **language and communication skills**
to **teach, guide, translate, and onboard** others into Web3 â€” and **earn crypto** for real contribution.

## Problem

- Web3 adoption needs **human onboarding** (live guidance, local language support).
- Language access is uneven; incentives for helpers are weak or ad hoc.

## Solution

- **Live sessions** (Huddle01) and **token-gated rooms** via wallet.
- **Proof of participation/skill** using POAP or lightweight credential NFTs.
- **Micro-rewards** for verified tasks: teaching, moderating, translating, or guiding.

## Initial Users

- Spanish speakers (teachers/mentors) in LatAm, and global learners seeking human guidance.

## Value

- Learners: trusted, human help.
- Contributors: income + credentials + reputation.
- Ecosystem: scalable, community-driven onboarding.
